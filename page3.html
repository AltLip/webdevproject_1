  <h1>Frutiger Aero Aesthetic</h1>

  <p>The Frutiger Aero aesthetic was a popular marketing aesthetic commonly used between 2005 and 2013. Its name comes from Adrian Frutiger, a swiss typeface disigner who worked on many humanist computer interfaces, and Aero, a Windows Vista visual style. The aesthetic had a focus on connectivity and cleanliness, which is reflected in the main motifs found in most images.</p>
  <p>Motifs include:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Water</li>
  	<li>Bubbles</li>
  	<li>Fish</li>
  	<li>Bright Colors</li>
  	<li>Fruits</li>
  	<li>Globes</li>
  	<li>Planes</li>
  	<li>Grass</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An important aspect of Frutiger Aero is its emphasis on skeuomorphism. Skeuomorphism is a term used to describe digital design and interfaces that resemble their real-world counterparts so as to silently instruct users on how to use whatever function it is attached to. The design as a whole has since become obsolete, however. Seeing as skeuomorphism was used as a way to guide users and consumers into being more comfortable in an increasingly digital era, it was bound to become redundant once people learned how to interact with new devices.</p> 



  <p>Some examples of skeuomorphism and Frutiger Aero include:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Windows Vista and 7</li>
  	<li>Softsoap Hand Soap</li>
  	<li>iPhone Home Screen (pre-iOS 7)</li>
  	<li>Wii and Xbox 360 home screens</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While the aesthetic has since become a rarity in advertising, being replaced with more modern and sleek design, Frutiger Aero has gained a cult following in recent years, primarily among late Millenials (95, 96) and early-mid Gen Z (97-06). These groups tend to feel a lot of nostalgia for the aesthetic, seeing as it was incredibly prevelant in nearly all media during its heyday. There are certain images and sounds that are incredibly reminiscent of Frutiger Aero, usually coming from advertisements, games, or operating systems.</p>
